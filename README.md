## 💼 Projects

### **Ichundmeinewelt Monorepo**
**Solo Entrepreneur Edition** – A modular, production‑grade pnpm monorepo powering my business operations, content management, CRM, and automations.
Built with **Keystone.js 6**, **Prisma**, **Next.js 14**, **Playwright**, **pg‑boss**, and a shared TypeScript codebase.  
Designed for:
- **Single source of truth** for all business data
- **Scalable microservice pattern** within a monorepo
- **Shared code & types** across apps
- **Queue‑aware ingestion** to decouple heavy scraping from API requests

**Purpose:**  
To unify all business‑critical systems in a single, maintainable codebase — enabling rapid feature growth, consistent data models, and seamless integration between backend services, automation workers, and the public landing page.

### **E‑Commerce PIM System**
A modular, scalable product information management system for e‑commerce platforms.  
Built with **Node.js/TypeScript**, **Keystone.js**, **GraphQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**.  
Deployed on **Azure Cloud** with CI/CD pipelines, RBAC, and API‑Security.

### **Smart‑Home System**
A fully integrated, **off‑cloud**, privacy‑aware smart‑home ecosystem.  
Runs on a **local Docker‑Swarm cluster** with Traefik, GlusterFS, and multiple IoT services.  
Supports IR, BLE, ZigBee, WiFi, and wired integrations.  
Managed with **Ansible** for orchestration, ensuring high availability and maximum data privacy.

### **AI Commit‑Gen Service**
Queue‑based commit message generator leveraging **Azure OpenAI** and **LangChain.js**.  
Optimized for developer workflows and semantic commit standards.

### **TTS Package**
Event‑driven text‑to‑speech pipeline with multi‑channel input support.  
Integrates with IoT devices and conversational AI interfaces.
