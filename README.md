👋 Hi, I’m @TheGreenJosip
I'm 25 years old and live in Graz. A city in Ausria, Europe. A few months ago I finished my diploma for web-developement and now I'm accumulating the information into 
my own project. As I moved out from my parents i started to make my flat smart. In every aspect. Soon i bought myself
a raspberry and started to love coding different scripts. Over the time i aquired a wide base of knowledge around linux, javaScript, bash, NodeJS, PHP, SQL and a
bit of python. After short time i realized that i found my passion where i want to spend the rest of my time.

👀 I love reading and aquiring new information so I need dedicated time to spend with my macBook every day, otherwise I'm getting dis-balanced. Currently
I'm working on Home Assistant in the dockerized version after it replaced homebridge a time ago. I thrive doing things around my smart home and want to start a career 
in that field soon. 

in the past 4 years i worked with: 
 - Linux Debian
 - Docker
 - node.js
 - different API's
 - websocket communication
 - bluetooth & WIFi presence detection
 - ESPHome & custom firmwares for tuya devices 
 - zigBee & MQTT 
 - bash scripting
 - LAMP-servers
 - HAP-node.js 
 - AppDaemons
 - NodeRED
 - DIY circuits

🌱 I’m currently learning javaScript because i want to write my own code which serves my purpose best. Also I'm working on my own website to write about my projects 
and implementations and to share knowledge with the community from which i learned so much. I appreciate this source of information very much and I want to contribute
my part to that.

💞️ I would love to learn more and maybe start collaborating with someone in the future. I will try to document my code regularly :)
📫 If you would like to reach me, feel free to write a private message. 

Thanks for your time!
